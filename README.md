# Road Pavement Damage Detection using Detectron2

## Overview
This project aims to detect pavement damage, such as cracks and potholes, using Detectron2, a state-of-the-art object detection library. Early identification of pavement damage helps ensure road safety, reduce maintenance costs, and prevent accidents. The model is trained on street-view images to accurately detect and localize damages across urban roads.

## Features
Uses Detectron2 for object detection and segmentation.
Detects multiple types of road damage from street-view images.
Achieves high precision and performance on urban road datasets.
Can process real-time input and large-scale datasets.
